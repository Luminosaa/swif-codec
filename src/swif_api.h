 * @param dec   context (i.e., pointer to decoder structure).
 * @param source_symbol_removed_from_linear_system_callback
 *              (IN) Pointer to the function, within the application, that
 *              needs to be called each time a source symbol is removed from
 *              the left side of the linear system.
 *              This callback is called each time the linear system slides
 *              to the right and an old source symbol needs to be removed
 *              on the left. This function does not return anything.
 * @param decodable_source_symbol_callback
 *              (IN) Pointer to the function, within the application, that
 *              needs to be called each time a source symbol is decodable.
 *              What it does is application-dependent, but it MUST return
 *              either a pointer to a data buffer, left uninitialized, of
 *              the appropriate size, or NULL if the application prefers to
 *              let the codec allocate the buffer.
 *              In any case the codec is responsible for storing the actual
 *              symbol value within the data buffer. Also, no matter
 *              whether the data buffer is allocated by the application or
 *              the codec, it is the responsibility of the application to
 *              free this buffer when needed, once decoding is over (but
 *              not before since the codec does not keep any internal copy).
 * @param decoded_source_symbol_callback
 *              (IN) Pointer to the function, within the application, that
 *              needs to be called each time a source symbol is decodable and
 *              all computations performed (i.e., the buffer does contain the
 *              symbol value).
 *              This callback is called in a second time, when the newly
 *              decodable source symbol is actually decoded and ready,
 *              i.e., when all the computations (like XOR and GF(2**8)
 *              operations) have been performed. In any case, it is the
 *              responsibility of the application to free this buffer when
 *              needed, once decoding is over (but not before since the
 *              codec does not keep any internal copy). This function does
 *              not return anything.
 * @param context_4_callback
 *              (IN) Pointer to the application-specific context that will be
 *              passed to the callback function (if any). This context is not
 *              interpreted by this function.
