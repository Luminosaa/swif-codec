/*
 * Fills in the table of coding coefficients (of the right size)
 * provided with the appropriate number of coding coefficients to
 * use for the repair symbol key provided.
 *
 * (in) repair_key    key associated to this repair symbol. This
 *                    parameter is ignored (useless) if m=2 and dt=15
 * (in/out) cc_tab[]  pointer to a table of the right size to store
 *                    coding coefficients. All coefficients are
 *                    stored as bytes, regardless of the m parameter,
 *                    upon return of this function.
 * (in) cc_nb         number of entries in the table. This value is
 *                    equal to the current encoding window size.
 * (in) dt            integer between 0 and 15 (inclusive) that
 *                    controls the density. With value 15, all
 *                    coefficients are guaranteed to be non zero
 *                    (i.e. equal to 1 with GF(2) and equal to a
 *                    value in {1,... 255} with GF(2^^8)), otherwise
 *                    a fraction of them will be 0.
 * (in) m             Finite Field GF(2^^m) parameter. In this
 *                    document only values 1 and 8 are considered.
 * (out)              returns an error code
